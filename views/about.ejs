          <!-- about me paragraph here -->
          Hi! My name is Hannah and I'm a second year student studying
          Technology Management at Ontario Tech. I'm originally from a small
          place known as the Sunshine Coast in British Columbia, but moved to
          Oshawa, Ontario for my schooling. I wanted to share a bit about where I am from, so that is what my video is about!<br />
          If I'm not in school, I'm usually working as a barista or spending my
          time crocheting. I usually spend my summers in B.C. hiking,
          adventuring, and swimming, or playing with my two dogs. A fun fact
          about me is that when I finished high school, I moved to Germany for a
          year to travel! <br />
          Eventually, I'm hoping to work in the field of UX Design (User
          Experience Design), while also being able to continue traveling one
          day.
